\maketitle

This is the preliminary literature list. Its the result of an initial horizontal search (browsing through conference proceedings and journals). A vertical search (following forward and backward references) will be needed as well to sufficiently cover existing previous work in this particular area.

So far my search covered: CHI '07-11, TEI '07-11, SMC '08-'11, Computer Music Journal '07--, NIME '10 \& '11.

I limited my horizontal search to publications from 2007 and newer. The \emph{wi}i was launched world wide in november/december 2006 and my main search target was publications using the \emph{Wiimote} or similar devices. 

Further ground that might be fruitful is \emph{tangible user interfaces} since some interaction patterns and metaphors might be similar. Another area that I have not entered yet is \emph{VR} regarding the use of the \emph{Wiimote} as a controller in the virtual environment.

I didn't find the time to add comments to the list yet.
