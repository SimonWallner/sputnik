abstract = {Is there a distinction between New Interfaces for Musical Expression and New Interfaces for Controlling Sound? This article begins with a brief overview of expression in musical performance, and examines some of the characteristics of effective “expressive” computer music instruments. It becomes apparent that sophisticated musical expression requires not only a good control interface but also virtuosic mastery of the instrument it controls. By studying effective acoustic instruments, choosing intuitive but complex gesture-sound mappings that take advantage of established instrumental skills, designing intelligent characterizations of performance gestures, and promoting long-term dedicated practice on a new interface, computer music instrument designers can enhance the expressive quality of computer music performance.},

@article{Gamberini2011,
abstract = {This paper describes an issue-based method to evaluate the naturalness of an interface. The method consists of the execution of a series of tasks on that interface, which is subsequently systematically analyzed to identify breakdowns in the users’ actions. The systematic analysis of breakdowns is allowed by the support of video-coding software (The Observer by Noldus). This method is described on its theoretical bases and then applied to the evaluation of a natural interface, a walk-in-place locomotion system for virtual spaces called Superfeet. The procedure is comparative, since Superfeet is compared to two locomotion devices, Superfeet enhanced with headtracker and a more traditional Joypad. The test involves 36 participants (mean age = 23.68, SD = 3.14). The outcomes of the breakdown analysis are illustrated at a progressively finer level of granularity from the amount and length of breakdowns, to the circumstances of the breakdowns, to the type of actions involved in the breakdowns. The potential of this procedure for usability studies is finally synthesized.},

We present mixiTUI, a tangi- ble sequencer that allows electronic musicians to import and perform electronic music. mixiTUI is developed in collab- oration with electronic musicians, with a focus on live ar- ranging, on visualizations of music, on tokens that represent key elements in live performances, and on how the audience experiences the tangible interface. We present an evaluation of mixiTUI in a concert with 117 participants and argue that mixiTUI improves both the audience’s and the musician’s experience.},

@book{Ishii1997,
abstract = {This paper presents our vision of Human Computer Interaction (HCI): "Tangible Bits." Tangible Bits allows users to "grasp \& manipulate" bits in the center of users’ attention by coupling the bits with everyday physical objects and architectural surfaces. Tangible Bits also enables users to be aware of background bits at the periphery of human perception using ambient display media such as light, sound, airflow, and water movement in an augmented space. The goal of Tangible Bits is to bridge the gaps between both cyberspace and the physical environment, as well as the foreground and background of human activities. This paper describes three key concepts of Tangible Bits: interactive surfaces; the coupling of bits with graspable physical objects; and ambient media for background awareness. We illustrate these concepts with three prototype systems – the metaDESK, transBOARD and ambientROOM – to identify underlying research issues.},
