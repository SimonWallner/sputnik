@inproceedings{Dobrian2006,
	Abstract = {Is there a distinction between New Interfaces for Musical Expression and New Interfaces for Controlling Sound? This article begins with a brief overview of expression in musical performance, and examines some of the characteristics of effective ``expressive'' computer music instruments. It becomes apparent that sophisticated musical expression requires not only a good control interface but also virtuosic mastery of the instrument it controls. By studying effective acoustic instruments, choosing intuitive but complex gesture-sound mappings that take advantage of established instrumental skills, designing intelligent characterizations of performance gestures, and promoting long-term dedicated practice on a new interface, computer music instrument designers can enhance the expressive quality of computer music performance.},

@article{Gamberini2011,
	Abstract = {This paper describes an issue-based method to evaluate the naturalness of an interface. The method consists of the execution of a series of tasks on that interface, which is subsequently systematically analyzed to identify breakdowns in the users' actions. The systematic analysis of breakdowns is allowed by the support of video-coding software (The Observer by Noldus). This method is described on its theoretical bases and then applied to the evaluation of a natural interface, a walk-in-place locomotion system for virtual spaces called Superfeet. The procedure is comparative, since Superfeet is compared to two locomotion devices, Superfeet enhanced with headtracker and a more traditional Joypad. The test involves 36 participants (mean age = 23.68, SD = 3.14). The outcomes of the breakdown analysis are illustrated at a progressively finer level of granularity from the amount and length of breakdowns, to the circumstances of the breakdowns, to the type of actions involved in the breakdowns. The potential of this procedure for usability studies is finally synthesized.},

@inproceedings{Pedersen2011,
	Abstract = {We present interaction techniques for tangible tabletop in- terfaces that use active, motorized tangibles, what we call Tangible Bots. Tangible Bots can reflect changes in the digital model and assist users by haptic feedback, by cor- recting errors, by multi-touch control, and by allowing ef- ficient interaction with multiple tangibles. A first study shows that Tangible Bots are usable for fine-grained manipu- lation (e.g., rotating tangibles to a particular orientation); for coarse movements, Tangible Bots become useful only when several tangibles are controlled simultaneously. Participants prefer Tangible Bots and find them less taxing than passive, non-motorized tangibles. A second study focuses on use- fulness by studying how electronic musicians use Tangible Bots to create music with a tangible tabletop application. We conclude by discussing the further potential of active tangi- bles, and their relative benefits over passive tangibles and multi-touch.},

	Abstract = {Tangible user interfaces for manipulating audio and music focus mostly on generating music on the spot, but rarely on how electronic musicians balance preparation and improvi- sation in staging live performances or on how the audience perceives the performances. We present mixiTUI, a tangi- ble sequencer that allows electronic musicians to import and perform electronic music. mixiTUI is developed in collab- oration with electronic musicians, with a focus on live ar- ranging, on visualizations of music, on tokens that represent key elements in live performances, and on how the audience experiences the tangible interface. We present an evaluation of mixiTUI in a concert with 117 participants and argue that mixiTUI improves both the audience's and the musician's experience.},
