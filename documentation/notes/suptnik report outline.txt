Problem Statement
 - how to create an expressive virtual instrument that can be used in live and impromptu settings
 - make it visually pleasing, for both the performer and the audience
 - rather simple and accessible interface, 
 - more complex mapping with simple interface, not just mapping of axis.
 - have a virtual interface



Questions:
 - How well does the arc of light/fishing rod metaphor perform in terms of:
	- user performance, how easy is it to interact?
	- feel of the virtual environment, can certain object properties be felt?
	- precision: how precise is the control
	- improvements?
	- does is feel powerfull/controlable/?

 - Can this interface be considered tangible?

 - visually
	- is the scene visually pleasing?
	- would this improve a live performance?
	- improvements?
	- what is the visual expression? --> narrative

 - narrative/immersion?
	- what is it?
	- what story does it tell?
	- do you feel immersed into the scene?

 - modell/naturalism/affordance
	- can users create a mental model of the object, both physical and musical

 - music
	- how well suited is it to control music
	- is it/what is needed to be expressive
	- what possible instruments/uses?
	- rate the level of perceived mastery form 1 to 10. this is a corrollary to the perceived potential. high potential should correlate with low mastery.

 - other uses
	- what other uses can you envision?

 - wiimote pointer interaction
	- how easy is it to control the pointer/arc?

even though this project is stricly speaking not a tangible interface, it shares some similarities and qualities of TUIs. ...
